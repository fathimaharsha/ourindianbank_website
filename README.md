# Our Indian Bank website

Click here to check out The Indian Bank's website: http://ourbank.pythonanywhere.com/
<br>
Its a very basic website created using the Python Django framework in the Pycharm IDE. <br>
I used MVT architecture as the design pattern. We can register a user, login with that credentials, submit the application form and also can search for some districts.

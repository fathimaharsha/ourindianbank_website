# Our Indian Bank website

Click here to check out The Indian Bank's website: http://ourbank.pythonanywhere.com/
<br><br>
Its a very basic website which can be used for banking. Its created using the Python Django framework in the Pycharm IDE. <br><br>
I used MVT architecture as the design pattern. We can register a user, login with that credentials, submit the application form and also can search for some districts.
<br>
<br>
And obviously, there are features like dropdown, dependent dropdown, checkbox and radiobutton in the form for Application.
<br><br>
I used XAMPP server to maintain data using phpMyAdmin.Itâ€™s used for managing MySQL database.
